Yale's film culture has notoriously been weak and divided, not because of a lack of talent or interest, but because there exists no infrastructure equal to that of the university's theater community. The Yale Film Association (YFA) is a new student group that needs a way to foster the campus's moviemaking talent: to build crews with complementary skills, mentor the next generation of filmmakers, and connect students interested in the moviemaking culture. The YFilm site is a medium with which to do that.
